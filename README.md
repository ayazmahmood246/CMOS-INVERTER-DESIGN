# CMOS-INVERTER-DESIGN
#### APPROACH:

We have to design a circuit which inverts the input like a not gate which is a basic gate or which inverts the output. 


| INPUT  |   OUTPUT  |
|--------|-----------|
|   O    |    1      | 
|   1    |    0      |

For designing this type of circuit we neeed a device which gives high output at low input and low input at high output you can think of bjt could work as an inverter



## NMOS INVERTER DESIGNING

First we need to understand the characteristics of an nmos transistor so we design a circuit in which we vary Vgs and Vds to get suitable characteristics
